Creating an Unmanaged Client Network
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will create an unmanaged network.

1.	Log on to your clusterâ€™s Prism UI (Element) as the **admin** user.

2.	Click the **gear** icon, scroll down in **Settings** to the **Network** section and click **Network Configuration**.

3.	Click **Virtual Networks** if not already selected.

4.	Click **Create Network**

5.	Fill out the **Create Network** dialog box as follows:

 * Name: **Unmanaged Client Network**

 * VLAN ID: **<Refer to Cluster Configuration Information>**

 * Enable IP address Management: **Leave unchecked**

6.	Click **Save** to create the network.

Creating a Managed Client Network
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this exercise you will create an IP address management (IPAM) or managed network.

1.	Click **+ Create Network**.

2.	Use the information in the table below to complete the Create Network dialog box:

 * Name: **Managed Client Network**
 * VLAN ID: **0 (zero)**
 * Enable IP Address Management: **Click the check box to enable**.
 * Network IP Address/Prefix Length: Refer to Cluster General Information
 * Gateway IP Address: Refer to Cluster General Information
 * Configure Domain Settings: **Uncheck the box**

3.	Scroll down and click **+ Create Poo**l.
4.	Fill out the **Add IP Pool** dialog box with the IP pool **Start Address** and **End Address** refer to the pool address range from the **Cluster Configuration Guide**.

Managing Open vSwitch (OVS)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will explore a few commands to manage Open vSwitch (OVS) from the CVM and use those commands to build an additional virtual switch.

1.	Using PuTTY, establish an SSH connection to one of your CVMs and log on with the **nutanix** user and password **(Refer to Cluster Configuration Guide)**.

2.	Use **allssh** to execute commands on all CVMs. To view network interface information, type the command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     allssh manage_ovs show_interfaces
 
 * How many network interfaces are on each node?
 * How many network interfaces are 10GbE?
 * How many network interfaces are 1GbE?

3.	To list existing bridges for each Nutanix node in the cluster, type the command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     allssh manage_ovs show_bridges

 * How many bridges are on each node?

4.	To show bridge uplinks for each Nutanix node in the cluster, type the command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    allssh manage_ovs show_uplinks

 * Which network interfaces are on bond (or port) br0-up of the f
